# SITE NEWS/POSTING RULES

1. Keep posts civil, constructive and polite
2. Keep discussion on topic to the post at hand.
3. Treat your fellow posters with respect.

The BA Forums have officially re-opened, and have been migrated a new platform (Hugo). We've also taken the time to revamp and clean up the small amount of posts, and have added quite a few plug-ins to help give additional functionality beyond hugo's standard feature set.
